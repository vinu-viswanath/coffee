        <h1>Coffee tastes better when it is <b>strong!</b></h1>
        <h2>Do you agree?</h2>
        <p>A 2017 review of clinical trials found that drinking cofffee is generally safe within usual level of intake and is more likely to improve health outcomes than to cause harm at doses of 3 or 4 cups of coffee daily. Exceptions include possible increased risk in women having bone fracctures, and a possible increased risk in pregnant womenof fetal loss or decreased birth weight. Results were complicated by poor study quality,and differences in age, gender, health status, and serving size.</p>

        <h1>TYPES</h1>

        <p>Coffee beans are the seeds of a fruit called a coffee cherry. coffee cherries grow on coffee trees from a genus of plants called coffea. There are a wwide variety of species of coffee plants,ranging from shrubs to trees.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Type of bean.</b>There are two main type of coffee species,Arabica and Robusta.Arabica originates from Ethopia and produces a mild,flavourful tasteing coffee. It is the most poppular type worldwide.The downside of Arabica beans is that they’re harder to grow. Because of this, Arabica beans are pricier. All coffee beans grow in the so-called Bean Belt, an area between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, in 50 countries around the world. But Arabica beans need extra shade, water, and high altitude to grow properly. These plants are more susceptible to plant diseases and must be grown at an altitude of at least 2,000 feet. They’re also smaller plants, measuring between 8 and 15 feet when fully grown. </li>

            <li><b>Type of rost.</b>Because of the flavor notes in light roast, it’s a popular choice for cold brew lovers. I know I love a cup of fruity cold brew iced coffee. The cold brew process also cuts down on the acidity so it may be a little easier on those with a sensitive stomach.
            Light roast coffee takes longer to extract properly so it’s best brewed slower than darker roasts. Pour over and cold-brew methods (as mentioned above) would be good options to experiment with.</li>

            <li><b>Type of grind.</b>Coffee ground size is important because it impacts the coffee extraction, brew, and flavor. Grind size affects is surface area. Coffee isn’t a dissolvable substance like sugar, rather it needs water to help pull the flavors out of it. The more chances water has to interact with coffee, the more extraction takes place. If you have one coffee bean and slice it in half, there is more surface area exposed that water can now reach. Cut the halves in half, and you have even more surface area. With this logic, larger coffee grounds will take longer to extract while smaller coffee grounds will extract quicker.</li>

            <li><b>Decaffeinated coffee.</b>Now we know what decaf coffee is, where did it come from? Decaf coffee was first commercially available in 1906 in Germany. Created by Ludwig Roselius, who thought his father died of too much caffeine, he made it his mission to create a blend that had all of the taste without what he thought was ‘poison’. However, he found the answer to his problems by accident. During one of the coffee bean shipments a box got immersed in seawater and when brewed it was discovered that the water had removed most of the caffeine content from the beans. This revelation led to Roselius, patenting a way of steaming coffee to remove the caffeine and it’s still a process which is used today.</li>
